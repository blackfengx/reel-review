We received our boilerplate gitlab repository today and I am working on setting up my personalized journal and branch.
I am also working on polishing and finalizing the wireframe and API endpoints so we can have a finished API design. Plotting areas of this
project have been semi-difficult since my brain wants to associate the modelling of the project off of my Django knowledge although FastAPI
will be a different beast. I plan to watch more videos to get a better grasp and deeper understanding.

# **February 10th, 2023:**
Woke up this morning and decided to study some FastAPI/Postgres videos before class, I plan to continue to fix the API Design .md file during our allotted time in class though. All explorations for Back-end and Front-end were released today and we decided to finish our endpoints, get them approved by Jimmy, and then study the explorations into the weekend. I have a general idea of how to get route handlers established, however, I believe these videos will solidify my knowledge and allow me and the group to come back on Monday ready to confidently code.

# **February 13th, 2023:**
Our group will begin coding today and we decided to place all hands on deck for authentication. It's been said that authentication is the hardest part of back-end, so we're looking to get that out of the way, plus most of our routers need authentication approval to allow entry.

As the day progressed we realized we had a bit more setting up to do than anticipated and spent the day setting up docker files and postgreSQL.

# **February 14th, 2023:**
Today we were stumped on PGAdmin setup for awhile and upon fixing it realized that it is not actually required. Was a bit of a blow to the morale, but setbacks are a natural part of coding and our team will bounce back harder than ever. We then proceeded to get one query set up and realized we are constantly referring to the videos on learn and after much struggle decided to take some more time to soak the information before we continue now that we have more experience with how it all connects.


# **February 15th, 2023:**
Today we were able to get the authenticator solved and we have begun to move onto the rest of the queries and routers. We are trying to figure out how to properly route our endpoints using the API.

# **February 16th, 2023:**
Routing the API to our code has proven to be a tremendous pain, for some reason we have had exceeding issues with this route in specific, however, we were able to solve the crisis during the weekend. There was also an issue with our .env files and not properly registering our keys. Many instructor/SEIR sessions later, along with many docker compose downs/ups, we were able to repair it. I believe the original problem stemmed from us running checking errors in the VSCode terminal rather than Docker itself.

# **February 21st, 2023:**
Today we worked to write all of the routers and queries for reviews.py along with finishing the calls to the third party API. We planned to move on to our last bit of authentication, however, we discovered the rest of the auth is erroring.

# **February 22nd, 2023:**
Today we were able to fix our back-end authentication, it turns out it was working the whole time, however, we inserted new tables into our SQL database and forgot to migrate changes.

# **February 23nd, 2023:**
Today we were very stuck with authentication once again in the front-end, while we were stuck we fleshed out what routes/other parts of authentication we could.

# **February 24th, 2023:**
Today we fixed the rest of the authentication on the front-end. We are continuing to lay out the skeletal structure of the rest of our components along with putting in the meat of some of them as well. We split off into groups of 2 after auth and are grouping together to tackle any blockers.

# **February 27th, 2023:**
Our group finished the skeletal framework of the components and we are now filling the components with code to result in an actual flowing product. Once again, we split into groups of 2 and tackled different components, coming together to tackle any blockers the group may have faced.

# **February 28th, 2023:**
Today we finished the functionality part of the project and moved onto Tailwind. We took a few hours to watch videos and learn the intricate different commands that can be implemented using this framework. We also split once again to hone our knowledge and came back together to ensure our vision was matching and flowed as a gorup.
