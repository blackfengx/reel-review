## **February 9th, 2023:**
 We received our boilerplate gitlab repository today and I am working on setting up my personalized journal and branch.
I am also working on polishing and finalizing the wireframe and API endpoints so we can have a finished API design. Plotting areas of this
project have been semi-difficult since my brain wants to associate the modelling of the project off of my Django knowledge although FastAPI
will be a different beast. I plan to watch more videos to get a better grasp and deeper understanding.
