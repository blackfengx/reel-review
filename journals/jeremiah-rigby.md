# **February 9th, 2023:**
Received our starter code from gitlab today and I am setting up my own journal to begin my daily writing.
We as a group are also trying to finish up the wireframe and api endpoints.
I plan on studying FASTAPI over the weekend


# **February 13th, 2023:**
We worked mostly on setting up the database and docker files. Bradley drove most of the afternoon. And I drove after afternoon break.
There is definitely a little bit of confusion on if we are doing things correctly. but we are pushing along and will troubleshoot as we run into any erros


# **February 14th, 2023:**
We worked much of the day on setting up our database and fixing bugs. The information given from learn for us to copy is not what is actually needed so under the instruction of one of our instructors we undid a lot of the damage that learn did and got our yaml file to a more functional and understanable code. We also spent a little bit of time working on the account queries in the afternoon. Todays drivers were Myself, Bradley, and Alexa.


# **February 15th, 2023:**
Today we spent most of the day working on authentication. Authentication is now done, and we have started on a few of the routers and queries as well. We can now create an account, login and logout.


# **February 21st, 2023:**
Today we completed most everything on the backend. We created the rest of our 3rd party api calls. as well as all crud calls for a review. The only thing we have left to do before the backend is complete, is to add authentication requirements for all of the endpoints that we want locked unless you're logged in.


# **February 21st, 2023:**
Today we finished up our backend by fixing some weird authentication bugs, we then moved on to the frontend and got data for movies and reviews working in our frontend to properly display data (nothing is styled). we plan to study up on front end authentication tonight then rally together tomorrow to get frontend auth done.
