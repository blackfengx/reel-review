We received our boilerplate gitlab repository today and I am working on setting up my personalized journal and branch.
I am also working on polishing and finalizing the wireframe and API endpoints so we can have a finished API design. Plotting areas of this
project have been semi-difficult since my brain wants to associate the modelling of the project off of my Django knowledge although FastAPI
will be a different beast. I plan to watch more videos to get a better grasp and deeper understanding.

Woke up this morning and decided to study some FastAPI/Postgres videos before class, I plan to continue to fix the API Design .md file during our allotted time in class though. All explorations for Back-end and Front-end were released today and we decided to finish our endpoints, get them approved by Jimmy, and then study the explorations into the weekend. I have a general idea of how to get route handlers established, however, I believe these videos will solidify my knowledge and allow me and the group to come back on Monday ready to confidently code.

Our group will begin coding today and we decided to place all hands on deck for authentication. It's been said that authentication is the hardest part of back-end, so we're looking to get that out of the way, plus most of our routers need authentication approval to allow entry.

As the day progressed we realized we had a bit more setting up to do than anticipated and spent the day setting up docker files and postgreSQL.

Today we were stumped on PGAdmin setup for awhile and upon fixing it realized that it is not actually required. Was a bit of a blow to the morale, but setbacks are a natural part of coding and our team will bounce back harder than ever. We then proceeded to get one query set up and realized we are constantly referring to the videos on learn and after much struggle decided to take some more time to soak the information before we continue now that we have more experience with how it all connects.


# **February 15th, 2023:**
Today we were able to get the authenticator solved and we have begun to move onto the rest of the queries and routers. We are trying to figure out how to properly route our endpoints using the API.
